Challenge:

Using the boilerplate, make a program that gets a list of countries from a website with their currency codes, then let the user choose a country and display the currency code of that country.

This is part one of a bigger "country scrapping" project we will complete in the following days.

This is how the program should work:





The website you should get the countries and currencies from is: https://www.iban.com/currency-codes
Save the name of the country and the "Alpha-3 code" in an array.
Some countries don't have currency (No universal currency), don't add them to the list.
Check the user input, only numbers from inside the country list are allowed.
When a country is selected, show the name and currency code.

```
